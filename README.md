# Tamanegi
A Homework Collaboration System

# Installation
Make sure to have node.js and mongodb installed. Start mongodb at the default port on your local machine.
After that, run: `npm install` followed by `npm start`. This launches the server at localhost, port 3000.
The application uses the mongodb database named tamanegi. To set up a demo user and some example questions,
go to `http://localhost:3000/setup`. You should see a `OK` message if everything has gone well. After this,
you can sign in using the username `test` and the password `pwd`.
